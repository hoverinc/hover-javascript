## The problem

~~I~~ **We** do a bunch of open source and want to make it easier to maintain so
many projects.

## This solution

This is a CLI that abstracts away all configuration for ~~my~~ **our** open
source projects for linting, testing, building, and more.

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and
should be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```
yarn add -D @hover/javascript
```

## Usage

This is a CLI and exposes a bin called `hover-scripts`. You'll find all
available scripts in `src/scripts`.

This project actually dogfoods itself. If you look in the `package.json`, you'll
find scripts with `node src {scriptName}`. This serves as an example of some of
the things you can do with `hover-scripts`.

### Overriding Config

Unlike `react-scripts`, `hover-scripts` allows you to specify your own
configuration for things and have that plug directly into the way things work
with `hover-scripts`. There are various ways that it works, but basically if you
want to have your own config for something, just add the configuration and
`hover-scripts` will use that instead of it's own internal config. In addition,
`hover-scripts` exposes its configuration so you can use it and override only
the parts of the config you need to.

This can be a very helpful way to make editor integration work for tools like
ESLint which require project-based ESLint configuration to be present to work.

So, if we were to do this for ESLint, you could create an `.eslintrc` with the
contents of:

```
{"extends": "./node_modules/@hover/javascript/eslint.js"}
```

Or, for `babel`, a `.babelrc` with:

```
{"presets": ["@hover/javascript/babel"]}
```

Or, for `jest`:

```javascript
const { jest: jestConfig } = require('@hover/javascript/jest');
module.exports = Object.assign(jestConfig, {
  // your overrides here

  // for test written in Typescript, add:
  transform: {
    '\\.(ts|tsx)$': '<rootDir>/node_modules/ts-jest/preprocessor.js',
  },
});
```

> Note: `hover-scripts` intentionally does not merge things for you when you
> start configuring things to make it less magical and more straightforward.
> Extending can take place on your terms. ~~I~~ _Kent_ think[s] this is actually
> a great way to do this.
